# Title:
Patients exposed to pesticides with breast cancer: characterization of prognostic markers

# Abstract:
Several studies have shown the damage that exposure to pesticides causes to human health. However, despite evidence on the negative impact of the use of synthetic chemicals, Brazil was the largest consumer of pesticides in the world in 2021. In this context, the present study seeks to identify possible relationships between occupational exposure to pesticides and the clinical profile of breast cancer in women treated at the Francisco Beltrão Cancer Hospital, in the west of the state of Paraná, Brazil. To this end, 386 patients were included in the study as having been diagnosed with breast cancer, of which 208 were occupationally exposed to pesticides and 141 patients were not exposed. Of these, parameters were analyzed grouped into 3 categories: patient, tumor and disease characteristics. Patients exposed to pesticides have a prevalence of 32.83% of the Luminal B molecular subtype, unlike non-exposed patients, who have a prevalence of the Luminal A molecular subtype (37.78%). Exposed patients also have a higher incidence of recurrence (10.19%), chemoresistance (21.26%) and death (7.21%) compared to patients not exposed to pesticides and the total population analyzed, suggesting a worse prognosis. Patients exposed to pesticides are more likely to have distant metastasis, affected lymph node, angiolymphatic emboli, and chemoresistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that seeks a relationship of variables related to breast cancer severity in the population exposed to pesticides.
